  # Notes about secondary ranges
  # You can create 30 secondary ranges in a given subnet. For each cluster, you need two secondary ranges: one for Pods and one for Services.
  # Note: The primary range and the Pod secondary range can be shared between clusters, but this is not a recommended configuration

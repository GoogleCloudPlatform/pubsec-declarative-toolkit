    gke-admin-proxy sub-package to deploy the instance resources.

    Depends on setters from its parent package.

    ***Note:*** Some resources use a double dash (`--`) to separate setters value, to work around a known behavior described [here](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/issues/3330).

    Multiple copies of this subpackage can exist by copying the entire folder to a new folder (i.e. subpackage2).
    This may be required to manage GKE clusters located in different subnets/regions.

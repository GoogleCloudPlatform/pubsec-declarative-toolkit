# SC-5, SC-5(2), SC-8 - Deploy public external load balancer in front of public facing web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic and enforcing additional security policies such as ssl etc.
# SC-12(3) - The GCP Certificate Manager - classic certificates - is used to generate asymmetric keys - SSL certificate-. This certificate is used to encrypt load balancer traffic.
# SI-4(10) - Client to load balancer traffic is encrypted, at which point it is deccrypted allowing inspection by Cloud IDS and other tools.

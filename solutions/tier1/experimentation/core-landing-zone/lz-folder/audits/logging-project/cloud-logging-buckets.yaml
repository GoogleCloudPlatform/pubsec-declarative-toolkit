# Cloud Logging bucket for Security logs: Cloud Audit, Access Transparency Logs, and Data Access Logs
# Logs are routed using a log sink to a central logging project into a dedicated log bucket
# AU-4(1), AU-9(2) - Log buckets are created in a logging project, isolating them from the source of the log entries in other projects

  # AU-9, AU-11 - RetentionDays sets the policy where existing log content cannot be changed/deleted for the specificied number of days (from setters.yaml), locked setting means policy cannot be changed, ensuring immutability.

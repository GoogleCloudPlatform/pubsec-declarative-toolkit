# 30 Day Cloud Guardrails Policies For Gatekeeper

This package contains a series of policies which are designed to help enforce the GCs [Cloud Guardrails](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails) Framework with deployments using Kubernetes [Config Connector Resources](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview) in [Config Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview) or a self-managed instance.

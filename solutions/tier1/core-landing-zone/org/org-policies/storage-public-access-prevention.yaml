# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/storage.publicAccessPrevention
#
# Secure your Cloud Storage data from public exposure by
# enforcing public access prevention. This governance policy
# prevents existing and future resources from being accessed
# via the public internet by disabling and blocking ACLs and
# IAM permissions that grant access to allUsers and allAuthenticatedUsers.
# Enforce this policy on the entire organization (recommended),
# specific projects, or specific folders to ensure no data is publicly exposed.

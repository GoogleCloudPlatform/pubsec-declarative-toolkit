# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.restrictVpcPeering
#
# This list constraint defines the set of VPC networks
# that are allowed to be peered with the VPC networks belonging to this project, folder, or organization.
# The allowed/denied list of networks must be identified in the form:
# under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID, under:folders/FOLDER_ID, under:projects/PROJECT_ID,
# or projects/PROJECT_ID/global/networks/NETWORK_NAME.
#
# This exception is for the VPCs in the hub project. It allows any vpc under this organization to be peered with
# the VPCs in the hub project.

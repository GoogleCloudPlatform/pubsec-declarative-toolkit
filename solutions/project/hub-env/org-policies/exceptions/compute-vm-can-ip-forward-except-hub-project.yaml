# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.vmCanIpForward
#
# This list constraint defines the set of VM instances that can enable IP forwarding.
# By default, any VM can enable IP forwarding in any virtual network.
# VM instances must be specified in the form:
# organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID, folders/FOLDER_ID, projects/PROJECT_ID,
# or projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/instances/INSTANCE-NAME.
#
# This exception is to allow the Fortigate VM in the hub project to forward traffic.

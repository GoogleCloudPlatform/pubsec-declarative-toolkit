# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/storage.skipDefaultNetworkCreation
#
# This boolean constraint skips the creation of the default network and related resources
# during Google Cloud Platform Project resource creation where this constraint is set to
# True. By default, a default network and supporting resources are automatically created
# when creating a Project resource.

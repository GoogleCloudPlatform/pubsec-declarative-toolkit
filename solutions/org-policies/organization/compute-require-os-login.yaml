# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.requireOsLogin
#
# This boolean constraint, when set to true, enables OS Login on all newly created Projects.
# All VM instances created in new projects will have OS Login enabled.
# On new and existing projects, this constraint prevents metadata updates that disable OS
# Login at the project or instance level.

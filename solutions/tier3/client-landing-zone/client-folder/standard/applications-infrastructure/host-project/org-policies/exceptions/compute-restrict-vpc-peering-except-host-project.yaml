# # GCP Organization Policies
# # Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# # https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
# #
# # Constraint: constraints/compute.restrictVpcPeering
# #
# # This list constraint defines the set of VPC networks
# # that are allowed to be peered with the VPC networks belonging to this project, folder, or organization.
# # The allowed/denied list of networks must be identified in the form:
# # under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID, under:folders/FOLDER_ID, under:projects/PROJECT_ID,
# # or projects/PROJECT_ID/global/networks/NETWORK_NAME.
# #
# # This exception is for the VPC in the host project. It allows VPCs from a defined list to be peered with
# # the VPC in the host project.

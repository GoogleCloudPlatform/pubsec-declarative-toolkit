# Delegate to host project, ingress LB health checks traffic (firewall) from IP ranges 35.191.0.0/16, 130.211.0.0/22 to VPC resources in shared VPC network
# AC-3(9), AC-4, AC-4(21), SC-7(5), SC-7(8), SC-7(9), SC-7(11) - All connections to or from virtual machine instances are allowed/denied via firewall rules configured in shared VPC network within host project or firewall policies in parent folders based on least-privilege principle. Each firewall rule applies to incoming(ingress) or outgoing(egress) connections, not both.

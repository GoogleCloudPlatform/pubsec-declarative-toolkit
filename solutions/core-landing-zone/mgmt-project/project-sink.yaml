# Project sink for the Platform and Component logs of the Landing Zone Management Cluster
# Destination: Cloud Logging bucket hosted inside logging project
# AU-3, AU-3(1) - Sink defined at folder that will allow all the projects underneath the folder to send the logs to the logging bucket in the logging project
# AU-4(1), AU-6(4), AU-9(2) - Log sinks sending the logs to same project in same region having a logging bucket
# AU-12, AU-12(1) - Log Sinks defined in Log Router check each log entry against the inclusion filter and exclusion filter that determine which destinations that the log entry is sent to

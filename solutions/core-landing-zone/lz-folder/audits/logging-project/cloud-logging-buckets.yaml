# Cloud Logging bucket for Security logs: Cloud Audit, Access Transparency Logs, and Data Access Logs
# Logs are routed using a log sink to a central logging project into a dedicated log bucket
# AU-7, AU-9 - The log buckets created within the Logging project are immutable (AU-7(B)). These buckets have a retention policy of 365 days and IAM Policy that defines who has access to the bucket (AU-9)
# AU-4(1), AU-6(4), AU-9(2) - Log sinks sending the logs to same project in same region having a logging bucket

# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging
#
# This boolean constraint disables serial port logging to Stackdriver from Compute Engine VMs belonging to the
# organization, project, or folder where this constraint is being enforced.
#
# By default, serial port logging for Compute Engine VMs is disabled, and can be selectively enabled on a per-VM or
# per-project basis using metadata attributes. When enforced, this constraint disables serial port logging for new
# Compute Engine VMs whenever a new VM is created, as well as preventing users from changing the metadata attribute
# of any VMs (old or new) to True. Disabling serial port logging can cause certain services that rely on it, such
# as GKE Autopilot, to not function correctly.

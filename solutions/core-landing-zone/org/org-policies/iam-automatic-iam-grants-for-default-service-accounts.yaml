# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts
#
# This boolean constraint, when enforced, prevents the default App Engine and Compute Engine service accounts that are created in your projects from being automatically granted any IAM role on the project when the accounts are created.

# TODO: investigate using client ns, move functionality to client-setup and/or create new client logging project. Will be required if a config-controller is deployed per client OR we need to give permissions to the client service account into the core logging project.
# Cloud Logging bucket for client Platform and Component logs
# Logs are routed using a log sink to a central logging project into a dedicated log bucket
# AU-7, AU-9 - The log buckets created within the Logging project are immutable (AU-7(B)). These buckets have a retention policy of xxx days and IAM Policy that defines who has access to the bucket (AU-9)
# AU-4(1), AU-6(4), AU-9(2), AU-12, AU-12(1) Log sinks sending the logs to same project in same region having a logging bucket
# AU-9(4), SI-4 - The centralized logging solution has a configuration in place that defines all logging buckets to be locked
# AU-11 - Logging bucket retention configuration

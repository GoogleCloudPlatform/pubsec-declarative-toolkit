# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains
#
# This list constraint defines one or more Cloud Identity or
# Google Workspace customer IDs whose principals can be added to IAM policies.
# To get the workspace ID, log in to admin.google.com as an admin user
# Go to Account settings > Profile.
# Next to Customer ID, find your organization's unique ID.
#
# Alternatively, the 'gcloud organizations list' command can be used to see all organizations
# for which you have the resourcemanager.organizations.get permission.
# This command will return the DISPLAY_NAME, ID (Organization ID), and DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID.
# The Google Workspace customer ID is the DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID.

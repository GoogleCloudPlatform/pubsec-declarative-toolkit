# Example: BYOL deployment in existing subnets

Note: this example references non-existing subnets. It will NOT *"just work"*.

This is an example use of the fgcp-ha-ap-lb module to deploy a BYOL FortiGate 7.0 HA cluster into existing subnets. The subnets are referenced as variables in terraform.tfvars and would not be created.

# Example: PAYG deployment in new VPCs&subnets

This is a working example demonstrating the use of the fgcp-ha-ap-lb module to deploy a PAYG FortiGate 7.2 HA cluster into newly created subnets (and VPCs). Mind that each subnet needs to be in a separate VPC (see [GCP Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-use-multiple-interfaces#specifications)).

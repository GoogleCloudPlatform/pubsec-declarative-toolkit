## KPT Packages

In order to maintain consistency accross kpt packages, we strive to maintain the following standards.

### Generic

1. Google's License text is included at the beginning of each resource file
1. Avoid blank lines
1. `metadata.name` include the `project-id` prefix only when K8S uniqueness is required
1. `spec.resourceID` include the `project-id` prefix only when GCP uniqueness is required
1. Resource's fields/subfields are ordered as per resource's schema
1. Resource's reference should use `name` instead of `external` as much as possible

### Comments

1. A comment line is included prior to every resources definition
1. The resource description field has the same information as the comment line at the beginning of the resource definition
1. Avoid comments on same line as a field
1. `kpt-merge` comment should be removed
1. Include a comment for every setter in `setters.yaml`

### Annotations

1. Include

    - `depends-on` for every resource

1. Remove :

    - `cnrm.cloud.google.com/blueprint: 'kpt-fn'`

### Markdown

1. `readme.md` is generated using the command below. Replace `REPO_PACKAGE_DIR` and `LOCAL_PACKAGE_DIR` accordingly.

    ```shell
    REPO_URL=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit.git/solutions/REPO_PACKAGE_DIR
    kpt fn eval -i generate-kpt-pkg-docs:unstable --mount type=bind,src="LOCAL_PACKAGE_DIR",dst="/tmp",rw=true -- readme-path=/tmp/README.md repo-path=$REPO_URL
    ```

1. `securitycontrols.md` is included in the package (where applicable)
1. Avoid images in documentation to maintain small sized packages

### Quality Assurance

1. Package can successfully be deployed in a GCP environment
1. Package can successfully be removed from a GCP environment
1. Config Connector, Config Controller, ConfigSync and Policy Controller logs are not showing any errors when deploying or removing the package

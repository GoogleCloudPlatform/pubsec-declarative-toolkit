# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess
#
# This boolean constraint requires buckets to use uniform bucket-level access
# where this constraint is set to True. Any new bucket in the Organization resource
# must have uniform bucket-level access enabled, and no existing buckets in the
# organization resource can disable uniform bucket-level access.

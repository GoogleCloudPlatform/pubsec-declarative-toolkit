# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/essentialcontacts.allowedContactDomains
#
# This list constraint defines the set of domains that email addresses added to Essential Contacts can have.
# By default, email addresses with any domain can be added to Essential Contacts.
# The allowed/denied list must specify one or more domains of the form @example.com.
# If this constraint is active and configured with allowed values,
# only email addresses with a suffix matching one of the entries from the
# list of allowed domains can be added in Essential Contacts.

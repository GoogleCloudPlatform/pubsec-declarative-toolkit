# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm
#
# This boolean constraint, when set to True, requires that all new Compute Engine VM instances
# use Shielded disk images with Secure Boot, vTPM, and Integrity Monitoring options enabled.
# Secure Boot can be disabled after creation, if desired. Existing running instances will continue to work as usual.

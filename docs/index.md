## GCP Canadian PubSec Sandbox

===========================

## What is this Public Sector Declarative Toolkit?

-----------------------------------------------

The Public Sector Declarative Toolkit is an opinionated way for Public Sector customers to standup a compliant Google Cloud environment that meets the governance and compliance regimes like the 30 day Canadian Cloud Guardrails [https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails-gcp](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails-gcp) in order to work with Google Cloud Platform solutions.

## What problem does this solve?

-----------------------------------------------

It's difficult to know all products and solutions built on / in Google Cloud Platform. This allows you to deploy a pre-built solution in a contained way to learn, investigate and experiment with different aspects of Google Cloud. You don't need to be an expert on GCP or Infrastructure as Code to deploy a solution, this makes solution deployment easy.

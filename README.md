# GCP PubSec Declarative Toolkit

The GCP PubSec Declarative Toolkit is a collection of declarative solutions to help you on your Journey to Google Cloud. Solutions are designed using [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) and deployed using [Config Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview).

## Current Solutions

When getting a package the `@` indicates what tag or branch you will be getting with the `kpt pkg get` command. The current version is set for `v0.0.3-alpha` and should be stable but you can use `main` if you want the latest changes as they come in.

## Quickstart

<!-- [![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit.git&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md) -->

In order to deploy the solutions we will need to activate a config-controller instance which we will then deploy a solution or solutions to it.

### arete cli Install

See arete [README](./cli/README.md) for instructions to build from source.

```shell
wget https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit/releases/download/v0.0.3-alpha/arete
chmod +x ./arete
sudo mv ./arete /usr/local/bin
```

#### Create the Config Controller Environment

Once you have `arete` installed we can create the Config Controller environment by running:

```shell
arete create my-awesome-kcc --region=northamerica-northeast1 --project=target-project
```

### Advanced Install

Follow the following [guide](docs/advanced-install.md) to deploy a standalone Config Controller instance or see the examples [directory](examples/) for example installation methods.

# GCP PubSec Declarative Toolkit

The GCP PubSec Declarative Toolkit is a collection of declarative solutions to help you on your Journey to Google Cloud. Solutions are designed using [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) and deployed using [Config Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview).

When getting a package you can use the `@` to indicate what tag or branch you will be getting with the `kpt pkg get` command for example `kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit.git/solutions/core-landing-zone@main`.

You can find the latest release versions in the `releases` [page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit/releases).

## Quickstart

In order to deploy the solutions you will need a Kubernetes cluster with [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) installed.

We recommend using the Managed Config Controller service which comes bundles with [Config Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) and [Anthos Config Management](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management), alternatively you can [install](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/advanced-install#manual) Config Connector on any CNCF compliant Kubernetes cluster.

See the Google Cloud [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/manage-resources-config-controller) guide for getting up and running with Config Controller

A setup script is provided in the repository [gcp-tools](https://github.com/ssc-spc-ccoe-cei/gcp-tools/blob/main/scripts/bootstrap/setup-kcc.sh) that will configure the Config Controller cluster.  The instructions in the [Advanced Install](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit/blob/main/docs/advanced-install.md) are automated as part of the [setup-kcc.sh](https://github.com/ssc-spc-ccoe-cei/gcp-tools/blob/main/scripts/bootstrap/setup-kcc.sh) script.

We have also put together the following [guide](docs/advanced-install.md) to deploy a standalone Config Controller instance or see the examples [directory](examples/) for example installation methods.

## Additional Documentation

You may want to look at the [documentation](https://github.com/ssc-spc-ccoe-cei/gcp-documentation) published by **[Shared Services Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/shared-services.html)**, providing a good level of details on how they have implemented the Landing Zone v2 solution to host workloads from any of the 43 departments of the Government of Canada.
